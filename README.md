Facebook started loosing its glory ;and the only necessity for it is to remind me of my friends birthdays!
Graph API doesn't let you access your friends information anymore and hence this tool scrapes information and sends all the birthdays to Google Calendar using Google Calendar API so you'll never miss another birthday!  

## instructions

Install all the requirements from requirements.txt  

Go to [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python#step_1_turn_on_the_api_name) and follow the instructions till step 2. Store the json file as "client_secret.json".  

Set the language in Facebook as English UK.  

Run the script  
`python3 fcukfb.py`
